### **Explanation of JSON Structure**

#### **1. Meta Information (`meta`)** *(required, object)*
- **`document_type`** *(required, string)*: Specifies the type of document. In this case, `ameax_sale` represents a sales opportunity.
- **`schema_version`** *(required, string)*: Defines the version of the schema being used.
- **`import_mode`** *(optional, string or null)*: Controls how records are processed during import. Valid values are:
  - `"create_or_update"` (default): Creates new records or updates existing ones based on identifiers
  - `"create_only"`: Only creates new records, ignores updates to existing ones
  - `"update_only"`: Only updates existing records, ignores new ones
  - `null`: Same as default behavior (`"create_or_update"`)

#### **2. Identifiers** *(required, object)*
- **`external_id`** *(required, string)*: A unique external identifier for the sales record.
- **`ameax_internal_id`** *(nullable, integer)*: An internal ameax ID that can be used as an alternative or in addition to external_id. **Note: When both `ameax_internal_id` and `external_id` are provided, `ameax_internal_id` takes precedence for record identification.**

#### **3. Customer Information** *(required, object)*
At least one of the following fields must be present:
- **`customer_number`** *(required if no external_id)*: Internal customer number
- **`external_id`** *(required if no customer_number)*: External customer identifier

#### **4. Basic Information**
- **`subject`** *(required, string)*: Title or subject of the sales opportunity
- **`description`** *(nullable, string)*: Detailed description of the opportunity
- **`sale_status`** *(required, string)*: Current status of the sale
  - Allowed values: "active", "inactive", "~~completed~~", "cancelled","terminated","lost","won"
- **`selling_status`** *(required, string)*: Current stage in the sales process
  - Allowed values: "identification", "acquisition", "qualification", "proposal", "sale"
- **`user_external_id`** *(required, string)*: External identifier of the responsible user
- **`date`** *(required, string, YYYY-MM-DD format)*: Date of the sales opportunity
- **`amount`** *(required, number)*: Expected sales amount (decimal with 2 decimal places)
- **`probability`** *(required, integer)*: Probability of closing the sale (0-100)
- **`close_date`** *(nullable, string, YYYY-MM-DD format)*: Expected closing date
> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** The value "completed" is deprecated and functionally identical to `won`. It will be removed in a future version.

#### **5. Rating System** *(required, object)*
The rating system contains evaluations for various aspects of the sales opportunity. Each rating consists of:
- **`rating`** *(required, integer)*: Rating from 1-7
- **`source`** *(required, string)*: Source of the rating
  - "known": Verified information
  - "assumed": Well-founded assessment
  - "guessed": Uncertain information

Rating categories:
- **`relationship`**: Quality of relationship
- **`proposition`**: Value proposition
- **`trust`**: Level of trust
- **`competition`**: Competitive situation
- **`need_for_action`**: Need for action
- **`buying_process`**: Buying process
- **`price`**: Price situation

#### **6. Create Actions** *(nullable, array)*
This section allows specifying actions to be created when the sale is imported. Currently supports:
- **`type`** *(required, string)*: Type of action to create. Currently only "remind" is supported.
- **`remind_date`** *(required for type "remind", string, ISO 8601 date-time format)*: Date and time for the reminder (e.g., "2025-07-15T10:30:00Z")
- **`subject`** *(required for type "remind", string)*: Subject/description of the reminder

When a "remind" action is included, a reminder will be created for the user assigned to the sale.

#### **7. Custom Data** *(nullable, object)*
This section allows for additional data fields that may be required for specific use cases.
- **`xsa_category`** *(nullable, string)*: Example of a custom categorization field
- **`what_ever`** *(nullable, string)*: Example of a custom data field for flexible extensions

##### **Custom Fieldlib Fields (xsa_ prefix)**

Fields with the `xsa_` prefix are dynamically handled by the legacy system as custom sale fields:

- Fields must start with `xsa_` to be processed as fieldlib fields
- These fields are extracted during import and sent to the legacy API
- Available fields depend on the legacy AM system configuration
- Field types and validation are handled by the legacy system
- Non-prefixed fields remain in custom_data but are not processed as fieldlib fields

Example:
```json
"custom_data": {
  "xsa_source": "website",
  "xsa_campaign": "summer2024",
  "xsa_referrer": "partner123",
  "internal_note": "High priority"  // non-xsa_ fields are ignored
}
```

This structured format ensures a standardized way of handling sales opportunities within the system.
